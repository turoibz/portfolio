## Gatsby + Drupal ðŸ”¥

1.  **Front-end built on Gatsby 5.x**

    I use Gatsby to generate all the static files. I built page templates, components and theme with React.

    ```shell
    # run the front-end
    npm run devlop
    ```

2.  **Drupal for content management**

    All project content is managed by the Drupal CMS (not included in this repository) and retrieved from the Drupal JSON API by Gatsby during the build process. Certain content is password protected and can only be accessed by logging in through the front-end


3.  **Deployed with Github actions**

    Whenever content is modified in Drupal, I can initiate a GitHub action through the CMS to deploy the static files to my hosting provider.
